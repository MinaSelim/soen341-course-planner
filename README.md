# Course-Planner

This project allows students to plan out their sequence for the rest of their degree at Concordia University.
Because of our design, it can be easily applied to multiple different universities, colleges, etc. 

When running the program, it will make api calls to the OpenDataConcordia API to fetch courses. Our algorithm will then prioritize courses and create a valid sequence that will describe the shortest path to graduation. 


# Instructions to run and install 

Open codebase on Eclipse, IntelliJ or an IDE of your choosing, you will use gradle to run and build the entirety of the project.
